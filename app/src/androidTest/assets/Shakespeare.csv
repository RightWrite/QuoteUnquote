Are of imagination all compact:
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold, That is, the madman; the lover, all as frantic,
Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:
The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,
Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;
And, as imagination bodies forth
The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing
A local habitation and a name.
Such tricks hath strong imagination,
That, if it would but apprehend some joy,
It comprehends some bringer of that joy;
Or in the night, imagining some fear,
How easy is a bush suppos'd a bear! V, i, 7"

The attribute to awe and majesty,
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
But mercy is above this sceptered sway,
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
It is an attribute to God himself,
And earthly power doth then show likest God's
When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
Though justice be thy plea, consider this,
That in the course of justice none of us
Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy,
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
The deeds of mercy. IV, i, 184"

There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
But in his motion like an angel sings,
Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins.
Such harmony is in immortal souls;

Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it. V, i, 54"

Can play upon it. Induction, l. 15"
KING HENRY THE FOURTH, PART II [1598]||"Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,

play with flowers and smile upon his fingers' ends, I
knew there was but one way; for his nose was as

Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,
Disguise fair nature with hard-favor'd rage;
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect. III, i, 1"

Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames
Each battle sees the other's umber'd face:
Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs
Piercing the night's dull ear; and from the tents
The armorers, accomplishing the knights,
With busy hammers closing rivets up,
Give dreadful note of preparation. IV, Chorus, 5"

Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers?
What are thy rents? what are thy comings-in?
O ceremony! show me but thy worth. IV, i, 256"
KING HENRY THE FIFTH [1598–1599]||"'Tis not the balm, the scepter and the ball,
The sword, the mace, the crown imperial,

The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp
That beats upon the high shore of this world,
No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous ceremony,
Not all these, laid in bed majestical,
Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave,
Who with a body fill'd and vacant mind
Gets him to rest, cramm'd with distressful bread. IV, i, 280"

As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
That visit my sad heart. II, i, 288"
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||"Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
Being so father'd and so husbanded? II, i, 296"
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||"When beggars die there are no comets seen;
The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes. II, ii, 30"
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||"Cowards die many times before their deaths;
The valiant never taste of death but once.
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,
It seems to me most strange that men should fear;
Seeing that death, a necessary end,
Will come when it will come. II, ii, 32"
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||Antony, that revels long o' nights. II, ii, 116
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||How hard it is for women to keep counsel! II, iv, 9

There is no fellow in the firmament. III, iii, 60"

""Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!"" III, i, 79"
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||"How many ages hence
Shall this our lofty scene be acted o'er,
In states unborn and accents yet unknown! III, i, 111"
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||"O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?
Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,
Shrunk to this little measure? III, i, 148"
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||The choice and master spirits of this age. III, i, 163

JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||"O! pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers;
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
That ever lived in the tide of times. III, i, 254"
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war. III, i, 273
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my cause; and be silent, that you may hear. III, ii, 13
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||Not that I loved Caesar less, but that 1 loved Rome more. III, ii, 22
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||As he was valiant, I honor him; but, as he was ambitious, I slew him. III, ii, 27
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||If any, speak; for him have I offended. I pause for a reply. III, ii, 36
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||"Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
The evil that men do lives after them,
The good is oft interred with their bones. III ii, 79"
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||"For Brutus is an honorable man;
So are they all, all honorable men. III, ii, 88"
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||"When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept;
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff. III, ii, 97"
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||"O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
And men have lost their reason. III, ii, 110"
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||"But yesterday the word of Caesar might
Have stood against the world; now lies he there,
And none so poor to do him reverence. III, ii, 124"
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||If you have tears, prepare to shed them now. III, ii, 174
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||See what a rent the envious Casca made. III, ii, 180
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||This was the most unkindest cut of all. III, ii, 188
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||"Great Caesar fell.
O! what a fall was there, my countrymen;
Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us. III, ii, 194"
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||What private griefs they have, alas! I know not. III, ii, 217
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||"I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:
I am no orator, as Brutus is;
But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man. III, ii, 220"
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||"For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,
To stir men's blood: I only speak right on. III, ii, 225"
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||"Put a tongue
In every wound of Caesar, that should move
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny. III, ii, 232"
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||When love begins to sicken and decay, It useth an enforced ceremony. There are no tricks in plain and simple faith. IV, ii, 20
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||An itching palm. IV, iii, 10
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||"I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
Than such a Roman. IV, iii, 27"
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||"I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,
When you are waspish. IV, iii, 49"
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||"There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats;
For I am arm'd so strong in honesty
That they pass by me as the idle wind,
Which I respect not. IV, iii, 66"
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||"A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,
But Brutus makes mine greater than they are. IV, iii, 85"
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||"All his faults observ'd,
Set in a notebook, learn'd, and conn'd by rote. IV, iii, 96"
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||"There is a tide in the affairs of men,
Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune,
Omitted, all the voyage of their life
Is bound in shallows and in miseries. IV, iii, 217"
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||"We must take the current when it serves,
Or lose our ventures. IV, iii, 222"
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||"The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
And nature must obey necessity. IV, iii, 225"
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||"But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,
And leave them honeyless. V, i, 34"
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||"Forever, and forever, farewell, Cassius!
If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;
If not, why then, this parting was well made. V, i, 117"
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||"O! that a man might know
The end of this day's business, ere it come. V, i, 123"
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||"O Julius Caesar! thou art mighty yet!
Thy spirit walks abroad, and turns our swords
In our own proper entrails. V, iii, 94"
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||The last of all the Romans, fare thee well! V, iii, 99
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||This was the noblest Roman of them all. V, v, 68
JULIUS CAESAR [1599]||"His life was gentle, and the elements
So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up
And say to all the world, ""This was a man!"" V, v, 73"

And know what 'tis to pity, and be pitied,

And all the men and women merely players:
They have their exits and their entrances;
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel, And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woful ballad
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier, Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lin'd,
With eyes severe, and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
His youthful hose well sav'd, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion, Sans teeth,
sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

HAMLET [1600–1601]||In the dead vast and middle of the night. I, ii, 198
HAMLET [1600–1601]||Armed at points exactly, cap-a-pe. I, ii, 200
HAMLET [1600–1601]||Distill'd Almost to jelly with the act of fear. I, ii, 204

HAMLET [1600–1601]||"Hamlet: His beard was grizzled, no?
Horatio: It was, as I have seen it in his life,
A sable silver'd. I, ii, 239"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||Give it an understanding, but no tongue. I, ii, 249
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"All is not well;
I doubt some foul play. I, ii, 254"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"Foul deeds will rise,
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
I, ii, 256"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"The chariest maid is prodigal enough
If she unmask her beauty to the moon;
Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes;
The canker galls the infants of the spring
Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd,
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
Contagious blastments are most imminent. I, iii, 36"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
And recks not his own rede. I, iii, 47"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||Give thy thoughts no tongue. I, iii, 59
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar;
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel. I, iii, 61"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"Beware
Of entrance to a quarrel, but, being in,
Bear 't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
For the apparel oft proclaims the man. I, iii, 65"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"Neither a borrower, nor a lender be;
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
This above all: to thine own self be true,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man. I, iii, 75"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"'Tis in my memory lock'd,
And you yourself shall keep the key of it. I, iii, 85"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"You speak like a green girl,

HAMLET [1600–1601]||"When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
Lends the tongue vows. I, iii, 116"

HAMLET [1600–1601]||The air bites shrewdly. I, iv, 1
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"But to my mind,—though I am native here

HAMLET [1600–1601]||Angels and ministers of grace defend us! I, iv, 39
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
That I will speak to thee. I, iv, 42"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"What may this mean,
That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
So horridly to shake our disposition
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls? I, iv, 51"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||I do not set my life at a pin's fee. I, iv, 65
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"The dreadful summit of the cliff
That beetles o'er his base into the sea. I, iv, 70"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"My fate cries out,

By heaven! I'll make a ghost of him that lets me. I, iv, 84"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||Something is rotten in the state of Denmark. I, iv, 90
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
And each particular hair to stand an end, Like quills upon the fretful porpentine. I, v, 15"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||Murder most foul, as in the best it is. I, v, 27
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed

HAMLET [1600–1601]||"O my prophetic soul!
My uncle! I, v, 40"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||O Hamlet! what a falling-off was there. I, v, 47
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,

And prey on garbage. I, v, 53"

HAMLET [1600–1601]||"Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,

With all my imperfections on my head. I, v, 76"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"Leave her to heaven,
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
To prick and sting her. I, v, 86"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"The glowworm shows the matin to be near,
And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire. I, v, 89"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"While memory holds a seat
In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
Yea, from the table of my memory
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records. I, v, 96"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||Within the book and volume of my brain. I, v, 103
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
My tables—meet it is I set it down,
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark. I, v, 106"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark,
But he's an arrant knave. I, v, 123"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. I, v, 166"

HAMLET [1600–1601]||"Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;

Hamlet: Excellent well; you are a fishmonger. II, ii, 173"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand. II, ii, 179
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"Hamlet: For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god kissing carrion,—Have you a daughter?
Polonius: I have, my lord.
Hamlet: Let her not walk i' the sun. II, ii, 183"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||Still harping on my daughter. II, ii, 190
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"Polonius: What do you read, my lord?
Hamlet: Words, words, words. II, ii, 195"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||They have a plentiful lack of wit. II, ii, 204
HAMLET [1600–1601]||Though this be madness, yet there is method in 't. II, ii, 211
HAMLET [1600–1601]||These tedious old fools! II, ii, 227
HAMLET [1600–1601]||The indifferent children of the earth. II, ii, 235
HAMLET [1600–1601]||Happy in that we are not over happy. II, ii, 236
HAMLET [1600–1601]||There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so. II, ii, 259
HAMLET [1600–1601]||O God! I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams. II, ii, 263
HAMLET [1600–1601]||Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks. II, ii, 286
HAMLET [1600–1601]||This goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors. What a piece of work is a man! How noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in form, in moving, how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! II, ii, 317
HAMLET [1600–1601]||And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not me; no, nor woman neither. II, ii, 328
HAMLET [1600–1601]||There is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out. II, ii, 392
HAMLET [1600–1601]||I am but mad north-northwest: when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw. II, ii, 405
HAMLET [1600–1601]||They say an old man is twice a child. II, ii, 413
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"One fair daughter and no more,

HAMLET [1600–1601]||Come, give us a taste of your quality. II, ii, 460
HAMLET [1600–1601]||The play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas caviare to the general. II, ii, 465
HAMLET [1600–1601]||They are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time: after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live. II, ii, 555

HAMLET [1600–1601]||"With devotion's visage
And pious action we do sugar o'er
The devil himself. III, i, 47"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"To be, or not to be: that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
No more; and, by a sleep to say we end
The heartache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause. There's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life;
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office, and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn No traveler returns, puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action. III, i, 56"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"Nymph, in thy orisons
Be all my sins remember'd. III, i, 89"

HAMLET [1600–1601]||I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God has given you one face, and you make yourselves another. III, i, 150
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"O! what a noble mind is here o'erthrown:
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword. III, i, 159"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
The observ'd of all observers! III, i, 162"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh.
III, i, 166"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"O! woe is me,
To have seen what I have seen, see what I see! III, i, 169"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue; but if you mouth it, as many of your players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus; but use all gently: for in the very torrent, tempest, and—as I may say—whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance, that may give it smoothness. O! it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows and noise: I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it out-herods Herod. III, ii, 1
HAMLET [1600–1601]||Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature. III, ii, 20
HAMLET [1600–1601]||To hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. III, ii, 25
HAMLET [1600–1601]||I have thought some of nature's journeymen had made men and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably. III, ii, 38

And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
Where thrift may follow fawning. III, ii, 65"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"A man that fortune's buffets and rewards
Hast ta'en with equal thanks. III, ii, 72"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"They are not a pipe for fortune's finger
To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
As I do thee. Something too much of this. III, ii, 75"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"My imaginations are as foul
As Vulcan's stithy. III, ii, 88"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||The chameleon's dish: I eat the air, promise-crammed; you cannot feed capons so. III, ii, 98
HAMLET [1600–1601]||Nay, then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a suit of sables. III, ii, 138
HAMLET [1600–1601]||There's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half a year. III, ii, 141

HAMLET [1600–1601]||"Ophelia: 'Tis brief, my lord.
Hamlet: As woman's love. III, ii, 165"

The hart ungalled play;
For some must watch, while some must sleep:
So runs the world away. III, ii, 287"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||You would pluck out the heart of my mystery. III, ii, 389

Hyperion's curls, the front of Jove himself,

Where every god did seem to set his seal,
To give the world assurance of a man. III, iv, 55"

If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,

And reason panders will. III, iv, 82"

Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
Looking before and after, gave us not
That capability and godlike reason
To fust in us unus'd. IV, iv, 32"
HAMLET [1600–1601]||"Some craven scruple

Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,
Nor set down aught in malice: then, must you speak
Of one that lov'd not wisely but too well; Of one not easily jealous, but, being wrought,
Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,
Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away
Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdu'd eyes Albeit unused to the melting mood,
Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees
Their med'cinable gum. V, ii, 338"

Strike flat the thick rotundity o' the world!
Crack nature's molds, all germens spill at once
That make ingrateful man! III, ii, 1"

KING LEAR [1605]||"Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are,
That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,
How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,
Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you
From seasons such as these? O! I have ta'en
Too little care of this. Take physic, pomp;
Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
That thou mayst shake the superflux to them,
And show the heavens more just. III, iv, 28"

KING LEAR [1605]||"How fearful
And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low!
The crows and choughs that wing the midway air
Show scarce so gross as beetles; halfway down
Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!
Methinks he seems no bigger than his head.
The fishermen that walk upon the beach
Appear like mice, and yond tall anchoring bark
Diminish'd to her cock, her cock a buoy
Almost too small for sight. The murmuring surge, That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,
Cannot be heard so high. IV, vi, 12"

KING LEAR [1605]||"Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;
Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;
Arm it in rags, a pigmy's straw does pierce it. IV, vi, 169"
KING LEAR [1605]||"Get thee glass eyes;
And, like a scurvy politician, seem
To see the things thou dost not. IV, vi, 175"

Gentle and low, an excellent thing in woman. V, iii, 274"

Never, never, never, never, never!
Pray you, undo this button. V, iii, 307"
KING LEAR [1605]||"Vex not his ghost: O! let him pass; he hates him
That would upon the rack of this tough world
Stretch him out longer. V, iii, 315"

Stop up the access and passage to remorse,

Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between
The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,
And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers. I, v, 38"

Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
Unto our gentle senses.
Banquo: This guest of summer,
The temple-haunting martlet, does approve
By his lov'd mansionry that the heaven's breath
Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,
Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle:
Where they most breed and haunt, I have observ'd
The air is delicate. I, vi, 1"

And pity, like a naked new-born babe,
Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubin, hors'd
Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
To prick the sides of my intent, but only
Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself

Have done to this. I, vii, 54"

To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain? II, i, 33"

Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell
That summons thee to heaven or to hell. II, i, 62"

Which gives the stern'st good-night. II, ii, 4"

MACBETH [1606]||"Methought I heard a voice cry ""Sleep no more!
Macbeth does murder sleep,"" the innocent sleep,
Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleave of care,
The death of each day's life, sore labor's bath,
Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,
Chief nourisher in life's feast. II, ii, 36"

Shall sleep no more, Macbeth shall sleep no more! II, ii, 43"

MACBETH [1606]||"Had I but died an hour before this chance
I had liv'd a blessed time; for, from this instant,
There's nothing serious in mortality,
All is but toys; renown and grace is dead,
The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees
Is left this vault to brag of. II, iii, 98"
MACBETH [1606]||"Who can be wise, amaz'd, temperate and furious,
Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man. II, iii, 115"

Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,

MACBETH [1606]||"Then be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flown
His cloister'd flight, ere, to black Hecate's summons
The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums
Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done
A deed of dreadful note. III, ii, 40"
MACBETH [1606]||"Come, seeling night,
Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day,
And with thy bloody and invisible hand
Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond

Makes wing to the rooky wood. III, ii, 46"
MACBETH [1606]||"Now spurs the lated traveler apace
To gain the timely inn. III, iii, 6"

Unreal mockery, hence! III, iv, 106"

Is fall'n into the sere, the yellow leaf;
And that which should accompany old age,
As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,
I must not look to have; but, in their stead,
Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honor,
breath, Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not. V, iii, 22"
MACBETH [1606]||"Macbeth: Canst thou not minister to a mind diseas'd,
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,
Raze out the written troubles of the brain,

Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff
Which weighs upon the heart?
Doctor: Therein the patient Must minister to himself.

There would have been a time for such a word.
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
To the last syllable of recorded time;
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
And then is heard no more; it is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing. V, v, 17"

Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow. Sonnet 94, l. 1"

Such seems your beauty still. Sonnet 104, l. 1"
SONNETS [1609]||"When in the chronicle of wasted time
I see descriptions of the fairest wights,
And beauty making beautiful old rime,
In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,
Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,
Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,
I see their antique pen would have express'd
Even such a beauty as you master now. Sonnet 106, l. 1"
SONNETS [1609]||"Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul
Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,
Can yet the lease of my true love control,
Suppos'd as forfeit to a confin'd doom.
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd,
And the sad augurs mock their own presage;
Incertainties now crown themselves assur'd,
And peace proclaims olives of endless age. Sonnet 107, l. 1"

To what it works in, like the dyer's hand. Sonnet 111, l. 6"
SONNETS [1609]||"Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments. Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bends with the remover to remove:
O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark, That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
It is the star to every wandering bark,
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
Within his bending sickle's compass come;
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
If this be error, and upon me prov'd,
I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd. Sonnet 116"

Is lust in action; and till action, lust
Is perjur'd, murderous, bloody, full of blame,
Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust;
Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight;
Past reason hunted; and no sooner had,
Past reason hated, as a swallow'd bait,
On purpose laid to make the taker mad:
Mad in pursuit, and in possession so;
Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;
A bliss in proof, — and prov'd, a very woe;
Before, a joy propos'd; behind, a dream. All this the world well knows; yet none knows well
To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.
Sonnet 129"

His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,
And then he falls, as I do. I have ventur'd,
Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,
This many summers in a sea of glory,
But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride
At length broke under me, and now has left me,
Weary and old with service, to the mercy
Of a rude stream, that must forever hide me.
Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye:
I feel my heart new open'd. O! how wretched
Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favors!
There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,
That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,
More pangs and fears than wars or women have;
And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
Never to hope again. III, ii, 352"

Thou fall'st a blessed martyr! III, ii, 444"
