He is blaspheming; who can forgive sins but God alone?” And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to them, “Why do you reason these things in your hearts? Which is easier, to tell the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven;’ or to say, ‘Arise, and take up your bed, and walk?’ But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”, he said to the paralytic, “I tell you, arise, take up your mat, and go to your house.” And he arose immediately, and took up the mat, and went out in front of them all; so that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, “We never saw anything like this.” Mark 2:4-12

Healing||Jesus went with them. When he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying to him, “Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof.

I tell this one, ‘Go.’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come.’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the crowd who followed him, “I tell you, I have not found such great faith, no, not in Israel.” And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the servant in good health. Luke 7:6-10
Healing||While he still spoke, one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house came, saying to him, “Your daughter is dead.

Only believe, and she will be healed.” When he came to the house, he did not allow anyone to enter in with him, except Peter, John, James, the father of the child, and her mother. All were weeping and mourning her, but he said, “Do not weep. She is not dead, but sleeping.” They were ridiculing him, knowing that she was dead. But he, taking her by the hand, called, saying, “Child, arise.” Her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something be given to her to eat. Luke 8:49-55
Healing||He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath day. And look, a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and she was bent over, and could in no way straighten herself up.

One of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice. He fell on his face at Jesus’ feet, giving him thanks; and he was a Samaritan. Jesus answered, “Weren’t the ten cleansed? But where are the nine? Were there none found who returned to give glory to God, except this stranger?” Then he said to him, “Get up, and go your way. Your faith has healed you.” Luke 17:12-19

When he had come near, he asked him, “What do you want me to do?” He said, “Lord, that I may see again.” Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight.

Peter, fastening his eyes on him, with John, said, “Look at us.” He listened to them, expecting to receive something from them.

Proverbs 24:23-25
Prosperity||Know well the state of your flocks, and pay attention to your herds: for riches are not forever, nor does even the crown endure to all generations.

Prosperity||For to the man who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he gives travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him who pleases God. This also is vanity and a chasing after wind. Ecclesiastes 2:26
Prosperity||Look, that which I have seen to be good and proper is for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy good in all his labor, in which he labors under the sun, all the days of his life which God has given him; for this is his portion. Every man also to whom God has given riches and wealth, and has given him power to eat of it, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labor—this is the gift of God. For he shall not often reflect on the days of his life; because God occupies him with the joy of his heart. Ecclesiastes 5:18-20

Prosperity||For as the rain comes down and the snow from the sky, and doesn’t return there, but waters the earth, and makes it bring forth and bud, and gives seed to the sower and bread to the eater; so shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth: it shall not return to me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing I sent it to do. Isaiah 55:10-11
Prosperity||Then you shall see and be radiant, and your heart shall thrill and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be turned to you, the wealth of the nations shall come to you. Isaiah 60:5
Prosperity||For I know the plans that I have for you,’ says the LORD, ‘plans for your welfare, and not for calamity, to give you hope and a future. Jeremiah 29:11
Prosperity||Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house, and test me now in this,” says the LORD of hosts, “if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough for.

Prosperity||See the birds of the sky, that they do not sow, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns, and your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of much more value than they? Matthew 6:26
Prosperity||And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They do not toil, neither do they spin, yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not dressed like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, won’t he much more clothe you, you of little faith? Matthew 6:28-30
Prosperity||“Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What will we eat?’, ‘What will we drink?’ or, ‘With what will we be clothed?’ For the unbelievers seek after all these things, for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. Matthew 6:31-33
Prosperity||But as for what was sown on good soil, this is the person who hears the word, understands it, and produces a crop that yields 100, 60, or 30 times what was sown.” Matthew 13:23/ISV
Prosperity||“For it is like a man, going on a journey, who called his own servants, and entrusted his goods to them.

Matthew 27:57-60

They all ate, and were filled. They took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and also of the fish. Those who ate the loaves were five thousand men. Mark 6:41-44
Prosperity||He commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground, and he took the seven loaves. Having given thanks, he broke them, and gave them to his disciples to serve, and they served the crowd. They had a few small fish. Having blessed them, he said to serve these also. They ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets of broken pieces that were left over. Now they were about four thousand. Then he sent them away. Mark 8:6-9
Prosperity||Jesus said, “Truly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or land, for my sake, and for the sake of the Good News, but he will receive one hundred times more now in this time, houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and land, with persecutions; and in the age to come, eternal life. But many who are first will be last; and the last first.” Mark 10:29-31
Prosperity||When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch.” Simon answered him, “Master, we worked all night, and took nothing; but at your word I will let down the nets.” When they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was breaking. They beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. They came, and filled both boats, so that they began to sink. Luke 5:4-7

Prosperity||If you have not been faithful in that which is another’s, who will give you that which is your own? Luke 16:12
Prosperity||The thief only comes to steal, kill, and destroy. I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly. John 10:10
Prosperity||“The thief does not constantly come, except to the end that he may steal, slaughter (slay for food – as for a feast – or, for a sacrifice) and destroy (utterly loose away). I Myself come so that they can progressively possess (would continuously have; could habitually hold) Life, and may continue possessing [it] in superabundance (or: and may have a surplus surrounding them in excessive amounts). John 10:10/JMNT
Prosperity||Jesus therefore said to them, “Children, have you anything to eat?” They answered him, “No.” He said to them, “Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” They cast it therefore, and now they weren’t able to draw it in for the multitude of fish. John 21:5-6

Prosperity||For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might become rich. 2 Corinthians 8:9
Prosperity||For this is not that others may be eased and you distressed, but for equality. Your abundance at this present time supplies their lack, that their abundance also may become a supply for your lack; that there may be equality. 2 Corinthians 8:13-14

For it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,” that the blessing of Abraham might come on the non-Jews through Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. Galatians 3:13-14
Prosperity||Now to him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us, Ephesians 3:20

Love||Jesus answered and said to him, “If anyone loves me, he will keep my word; and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our dwelling place with him. He who does not love me does not keep my words. The word which you hear is not mine, but the Father’s who sent me. John 14:23-24
Love||Even as the Father has loved me, I also have loved you. Remain in my love. If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and remain in his love. John 15:9-10
Love||This is my commandment, that you love one another, even as I have loved you. John 15:12
Love||Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends. John 15:13
Love||If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, since I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. John 15:18-19
Love||But God commends his own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 5:8
Love||And we know that all things work together for good for those who love God, to those who are called according to his purpose. Romans 8:28
Love||Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Could oppression, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? Even as it is written, “For your sake we are killed all day long. We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter.” No, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Romans 8:35-39

Love||Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law. Romans 13:8
Love||For the commandments, “Do not commit adultery,” “Do not murder,” “Do not steal,” “Do not give false testimony,” “Do not covet,” and whatever other commandments there are, are all summed up in this saying, namely, “You are to love your neighbor as yourself.” Love does not harm a neighbor. Love therefore is the fulfillment of the law. Romans 13:9-10
Love||But as it is written, No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has imagined the things which God has prepared for those who love him. 1 Corinthians 2:9
Love||Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. 1 Corinthians 8:1
Love||If I speak with the tongues of humans and of angels, but do not have love, I have become sounding bronze, or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. If I dole out all my goods to feed the poor, and if I surrender my body so that I may boast, but do not have love, it profits me nothing. 1 Corinthians 13:1-3
Love||Love is patient and is kind; love does not envy. Love does not brag, is not proud, does not behave itself inappropriately, does not seek its own way, is not irritable, does not keep a record of wrongs; does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. 1 Corinthians 13:4-7
Love||Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will be done away with. Where there are tongues, they will cease. Where there is knowledge, it will be done away with. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part; but when that which is complete has come, that which is partial will be done away with. 1 Corinthians 13:8-10
Love||But now faith, hope, and love remain—these three. The greatest of these is love. 1 Corinthians 13:13
Love||Let all that you do be done in love. 1 Corinthians 16:14
Love||But as you abound in everything, in faith, utterance, knowledge, all earnestness, and in the love from us that is in you, see that you also abound in this grace. I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love. 2 Corinthians 8:7-8
Love||Each person should give according as he has determined in his heart; not grudgingly, or under compulsion; for God loves a cheerful giver. 2 Corinthians 9:7
Love||The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all. 2 Corinthians 13:14
Love||I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I that live, but Christ living in me. That life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself up for me. Galatians 2:20
Love||For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision amounts to anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love. Galatians 5:6
Love||For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this: “You are to love your neighbor as yourself.” Galatians 5:14

Love||that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be strengthened to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know Christ’s love which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. Ephesians 3:17-19
Love||I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, beg you to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called, with all lowliness and humility, with patience, bearing with one another in love; being eager to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. Ephesians 4:1-3
Love||but speaking truth in love, we may grow up in all things into him, who is the head, Christ; from whom all the body, being fitted and knit together through that which every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, makes the body increase to the building up of itself in love. Ephesians 4:15-16
Love||Be therefore imitators of God, as beloved children. And walk in love, even as Christ also loved us, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling fragrance. Ephesians 5:1-2
Love||Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself up for it; that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word, that he might present the church to himself gloriously, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. Even so husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself. Ephesians 5:25-28
Love||This I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment; so that you may approve the things that are excellent; that you may be sincere and without offense to the day of Christ; being filled with the fruit of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God. Philippians 1:9-11
Love||If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassion, make my joy full, by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind; doing nothing through rivalry or through conceit, but in humility, each counting others better than himself; each of you not just looking to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others. Philippians 2:1-4
Love||Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honest, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there is any virtue, and if there is any praise, think on these things. Philippians 4:8
Love||Above all these things, walk in love, which is the bond of perfection. Colossians 3:14

Love||He who loves his brother remains in the light, and there is no occasion for stumbling in him. But he who hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes. 1 John 2:10-11
Love||Do not love the world, neither the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the Father’s love is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not the Father’s, but is the world’s. The world is passing away with its lusts, but he who does God’s will remains forever. 1 John 2:15-17
Love||See what kind of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God; and we are. For this reason the world does not know us, because it did not know him.

Love||For this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another 1 John 3:11

Love||But whoever has the world’s goods, and sees his brother in need, and closes his heart of compassion against him, how does the love of God remain in him? Little children, let us not love in word only, neither with the tongue only, but in deed and truth. 1 John 3:17-18
Love||This is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he commanded us. 1 John 3:23

Love||No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God remains in us, and his love has been perfected in us. 1 John 4:12
Love||We know and have believed the love which God has for us. God is love, and he who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him. 1 John 4:16
Love||There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has punishment. He who fears is not made perfect in love. 1 John 4:18
Love||We love, because he first loved us. 1 John 4:19
Love||If a man says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen. This commandment we have from him, that he who loves God should also love his brother. 1 John 4:20-21
Love||Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God. Whoever loves the Father also loves the child who is born of him. 1 John 5:1

Her mouth is smoother than oil, But in the end she is as bitter as wormwood, and as sharp as a two-edged sword. Proverbs 5:1-4
Words||My son, if you have become collateral for your neighbor, if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger; You are trapped by the words of your mouth. You are ensnared with the words of your mouth. Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, seeing you have come into the hand of your neighbor. Go, humble yourself. Press your plea with your neighbor. Give no sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids. Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the snare of the fowler. Proverbs 6:1-5

God||‘For in him we live, and move, and have our being.’ As some of your own poets have said, ‘For we are also his offspring.’ Acts 17:28
God||concerning his Son, who was born of the offspring of David according to the flesh, who was declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord Romans 1:3-4
God||For there is no partiality with God. Romans 2:11
God||As it is written, “I have made you a father of many nations.” This is in the presence of him whom he believed: God, who gives life to the dead, and calls the things that are not, as though they were. Romans 4:17

God||yet to us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we live through him. 1 Corinthians 8:6
God||Now I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; and were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea; and all ate the same spiritual food; and all drank the same spiritual drink.

God||Having been made perfect, he became to all of those who obey him the author of eternal salvation, named by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek. Hebrews 5:9-10
God||Now without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him, for he who comes to God must believe that he exists, and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him. Hebrews 11:6
God||looking to Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews 12:2
God||Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Hebrews 13:8

Romans 15:4-6
Encouragement||Follow after love, and earnestly desire spiritual things, and especially that you may prophesy. For the one who speaks in another language speaks not to people, but to God; for no one understands; but in the Spirit he speaks mysteries.

He who speaks in another language edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church. 1 Corinthians 14:1-4

Ephesians 6:10-12
Encouragement||Therefore, put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having the utility belt of truth buckled around your waist, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and having fitted your feet with the preparation of the Good News of peace; above all, taking up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one.

Encouragement||Now who is he who will harm you, if you become zealous of that which is good? But even if you should suffer for righteousness’ sake, you are blessed. “Do not fear what they fear, neither be troubled.” But sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord; and always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you, yet with humility and fear: 1 Peter 3:13-15
Encouragement||There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has punishment. He who fears is not made perfect in love. 1 John 4:18

Will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous who are in it? Be it far from you to do things like that, to kill the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be like the wicked. May that be far from you. Shouldn’t the Judge of all the earth do right?” The LORD said, “If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake.” Abraham answered, “See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord, who am but dust and ashes.

Will you destroy all the city for lack of five?” He said, “I will not destroy it, if I find forty-five there.” He spoke to him yet again, and said, “What if there are forty found there?” He said, “I will not do it for the forty’s sake.” He said, “Oh do not let the Lord be angry, and I will speak.

What if ten are found there?” He said, “I will not destroy it for the ten’s sake.” Genesis 18:23-32

Let it happen, that the young lady to whom I will say, ‘Please let down your pitcher, that I may drink,’ and she will say, ‘Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink,’—let her be the one you have appointed for your servant Isaac.

Prayer||The LORD said, “I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows. I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good and large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites. Now, look, the cry of the sons of Israel has come to me. Moreover I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.

But Moses’ hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side. His hands were steady until sunset. Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.

Gideon said to God, “Do not let your anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once. Please let me make one more test with the fleece; let it now be dry only on the fleece, and on all the ground let there be dew.” God did so that night, for it was dry on the fleece only, and there was dew all over the ground.

Hear me, LORD, hear me, that this people may know that you, LORD, are God, and that you have turned their heart back again.” Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. 1 Kings 18:36-38
Prayer||So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself down toward the ground, and put his face between his knees. And he said to his servant, “Go up now, look toward the sea.” So he went up, and looked, and said, “There is nothing.” Then he said, “Go again” seven times. And the servant went again seven times.

Incline your ear, LORD, and hear. Open your eyes, LORD, and see. Hear the words of Sennacherib, with which he has sent to defy the living God. Truly, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands, and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone. Therefore they have destroyed them. Now therefore, the LORD our God, save us, I beg you, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, LORD, are God alone.” Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ‘Whereas you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, I have heard you. 2 Kings 19:14-20

I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city for my own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.”’” 2 Kings 20:4-6
Prayer||Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up to the house of the LORD the third day?” Isaiah said, “This shall be the sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he has spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten steps, or go back ten steps?” Hezekiah answered, “It is a light thing for the shadow to go forward ten steps.

The sons of Israel fled before Judah; and God delivered them into their hand.

Prayer||Hezekiah the king, and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, prayed because of this, and cried to heaven.

When he had come into the house of his god, some of his own offspring killed him there with the sword.

Prayer||”And when you pray, you are not to be as the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I tell you, they have received their reward. But you, when you pray, enter into your inner chamber, and having shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you. And in praying, do not use vain repetitions, as the unbelievers do; for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking. Therefore do not be like them, for your Father knows what things you need, before you ask him.  Matthew 6:5-8
Prayer||Therefore, you should pray this way: ‘Our Father in heaven, revered be your name. Let your kingdom come. Let your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.’ Matthew 6:9-13
Prayer||“Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and it will be opened for you. For everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened.

If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him.  Matthew 7:7-11

Just say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I am also a man under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and tell another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and tell my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” And when Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to those who followed, “Truly I tell you, I have not found so great a faith with anyone in Israel. And I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, but the sons of the kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” And Jesus said to the centurion, “Go your way. Let it be done for you as you have believed.” And the servant was healed in that hour. Matthew 8:5-13

Prayer||But immediately a woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit heard of him came and fell at his feet. Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter. But he said to her, “Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.” But she answered him, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.” He said to her, “For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of your daughter.” Mark 7:25-29

Jesus asked him, “What do you want me to do for you?” The blind man said to him, “Rabboni, that I may see again.” Jesus said to him, “Go your way. Your faith has made you well.” And immediately he received his sight, and followed him on the road. Mark 10:48-52
Prayer||Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours. Mark 11:24
Prayer||They came to a place which was named Gethsemane. He said to his disciples, “Sit here, while I pray.” He took with him Peter, James, and John, and began to be greatly troubled and distressed. He said to them, “My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch.” Mark 14:32-34
Prayer||He came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, “Simon, are you sleeping? Could you not watch one hour? Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.” Mark 14:37-38
Prayer||Again he went away, and prayed, saying the same words. Mark 14:39
Prayer||And look, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders, and started shouting, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David. My daughter is severely demonized.” But he did not answer her a word. His disciples came and begged him, saying, “Send her away; for she cries after us.” But he answered, “I was not sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” But she came and worshiped him, saying, “Lord, help me.” But he answered, “It is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.” But she said, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.” Then Jesus answered her, “Woman, great is your faith.

Coming up at that very hour, she gave thanks to God, and spoke of him to all those who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem. Luke 2:36-38
Prayer||It happened, while he was in one of the cities, look, there was a man full of leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell on his face, and begged him, saying, “Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.” And he stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, “I am willing. Be cleansed.” And immediately the leprosy left him. Luke 5:12-13
Prayer||But he withdrew himself into the desert, and prayed. Luke 5:16
Prayer||It happened in these days, that he went out to the mountain to pray, and he continued all night in prayer to God. Luke 6:12
Prayer||When he heard about Jesus, he sent to him Jewish elders, asking him to come and save his servant. When they came to Jesus, they begged him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy for you to do this for him, for he loves our nation, and he built our synagogue for us.” Jesus went with them. When he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying to him, “Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof. Therefore I did not even think myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go.’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come.’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the crowd who followed him, “I tell you, I have not found such great faith, no, not in Israel.” And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the servant in good health. Luke 7:3-10
Prayer||It happened about eight days after these sayings, that he took with him Peter, John, and James, and went up onto the mountain to pray. Luke 9:28
Prayer||It happened, that when he finished praying in a certain place, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples.” So he said to them, “When you pray, say, ‘Our Father in heaven, revered be your name. May your kingdom come. May your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us day by day our daily bread. Forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.’” Luke 11:1-4
Prayer||He said to them, “Which of you, if you go to a friend at midnight, and tell him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread, for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him,’ and he from within will answer and say, ‘Do not bother me. The door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I cannot get up and give it to you’? I tell you, although he will not rise and give it to him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence, he will get up and give him as many as he needs. “I tell you, ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened. “Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, he won’t give him a snake instead of a fish, will he? Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?” Luke 11:5-13
Prayer||He also spoke a parable to them that they must always pray, and not give up, saying, “There was a judge in a certain city who did not fear God, and did not respect people. A widow was in that city, and she often came to him, saying, ‘Give me justice against my adversary.’ He would not for a while, but afterward he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God, nor respect people, yet because this widow bothers me, I will give her justice, or else she will wear me out by her continual coming.’” The Lord said, “Listen to what the unrighteous judge says. Won’t God avenge his chosen ones, who are crying out to him day and night, and yet he exercises patience with them? I tell you that he will avenge them quickly. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?” Luke 18:1-8
Prayer||He spoke also this parable to certain people who were convinced of their own righteousness, and who despised all others. “Two men went up into the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector. The Pharisee stood and prayed to himself like this: ‘God, I thank you, that I am not like other people, extortioners, unrighteous, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week. I give tithes of all that I get.’ But the tax collector, standing far away, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner.’ I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted.” Luke 18:9-14
Prayer||He took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and gave to them, saying, “This is my body which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” Luke 22:19
Prayer||“Simon, Simon, look, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat, but I prayed for you, that your faith would not fail. You, when once you have turned again, establish your brothers.” Luke 22:31-32
Prayer||Being in agony he prayed more earnestly. His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground. Luke 22:44
Prayer||And he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.” And he said to him, “Assuredly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.” Luke 23:42-43
Prayer||Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.” John 4:10
Prayer||When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and begged him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death. Jesus therefore said to him, “Unless you see signs and wonders, you will in no way believe.” The nobleman said to him, “Sir, come down before my child dies.” Jesus said to him, “Go your way. Your son lives.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way. As he was now going down, his servants met him, saying that his son was alive. John 4:47-51
Prayer||Jesus took the loaves; and having given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were sitting down; likewise also of the fish as much as they desired. John 6:11
Prayer||And whatever you ask in my name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.  John 14:13-14
Prayer||If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, ask whatever you desire, and it will be done for you. John 15:7
Prayer||You did not choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you will ask of the Father in my name, he may give it to you. John 15:16
Prayer||“And in that day you will ask nothing of me. Truly, truly I tell you, whatever you may ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you. Until now, you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be made full. John 16:23-24
Prayer||When they had come in, they went up into the upper room, where they were staying; that is Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James. All these with one accord continued steadfastly in prayer, along with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers. Acts 1:13-14
Prayer||Now when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place. Suddenly there came from the sky a sound like the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. Tongues like fire appeared and were distributed to them, and one sat on each of them. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them the ability to speak. Acts 2:1-4
Prayer||When they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were gathered together. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness. Acts 4:31
Prayer||Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them, who, when they had come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit; for he had not yet fallen upon any of them.

He said with a loud voice, “Fear God, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgment has come. Worship him who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and the springs of waters.” Revelation 14:6-7
Praise & Worship||They sang the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, “Great and marvelous are your works, Lord God of hosts. Righteous and true are your ways, O King eternal. Who would not fear you, Lord, and glorify your name? For you only are holy. For all the nations will come and worship before you. For your righteous acts have been revealed.” Revelation 15:3-4
Praise & Worship||After these things I heard something like a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, “Hallelujah. Salvation, glory, and power belong to our God: for true and righteous are his judgments. For he has judged the great prostitute, who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality, and he has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.” A second said, “Hallelujah. Her smoke goes up forever and ever.” The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne, saying, “Amen. Hallelujah.” A voice came forth from the throne, saying, “Give praise to our God, all you his servants, you who fear him, the small and the great.” I heard something like the voice of a great multitude, and like the voice of many waters, and like the voice of mighty thunders, saying, “Hallelujah. For the Lord our God of hosts reigns. Let us rejoice and be exceedingly glad, and let us give the glory to him. For the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his wife has made herself ready.” Revelation 19:1-7

Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, “My father?” He said, “Here I am, my son.” He said, “Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?” Abraham said, “God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” So they both went together. Genesis 22:5-8
Faith||Israel saw the great work which the LORD did to the Egyptians, and the people feared the LORD; and they believed in the LORD, and in his servant Moses. Exodus 14:31
Faith||Moses lifted up his hand, and struck the rock with his rod twice: and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their livestock.

Faith||They rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Listen to me, Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem.

He made a proclamation and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, “Let neither man nor animal, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed, nor drink water; but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and animal, and let them cry mightily to God. Yes, let them turn everyone from his evil way, and from the violence that is in his hands. Who knows whether God will not turn and relent, and turn away from his fierce anger, so that we might not perish?” God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way. God relented of the disaster which he said he would do to them, and he did not do it. Jonah 3:5-10
Faith||Look, if he holds back, my soul has no pleasure in him, but the righteous will live by faith. Habakkuk 2:4
Faith||And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They do not toil, neither do they spin, yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not dressed like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, won’t he much more clothe you, you of little faith? Matthew 6:28-30
Faith||And the centurion answered, “Lord, I’m not worthy for you to come under my roof. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I am also a man under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and tell another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and tell my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” And when Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to those who followed, “Truly I tell you, I have not found so great a faith with anyone in Israel. And I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, but the sons of the kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” And Jesus said to the centurion, “Go your way. Let it be done for you as you have believed.” And the servant was healed in that hour. Matthew 8:8-13
Faith||And when he got into a boat, his disciples followed him. And suddenly a violent storm came up on the sea, so much that the boat was covered with the waves, but he was asleep. They came to him, and woke him up, saying, “Save us, Lord. We are dying.” And he said to them, “Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?” Then he got up, rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm. Matthew 8:23-26
Faith||And he entered into a boat, and crossed over, and came into his own city. And look, they brought to him a man who was paralyzed, lying on a bed. And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, “Son, cheer up. Your sins are forgiven.” Matthew 9:1-2
Faith||And look, a woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years came behind him, and touched the fringe of his garment; for she said within herself, “If I just touch his garment, I will be made well.” But Jesus, turning around and seeing her, said, “Daughter, cheer up. Your faith has made you well.” And the woman was made well from that hour. Matthew 9:20-22
Faith||And as Jesus passed by from there, two blind men followed him, calling out and saying, “Have mercy on us, son of David.” And when he had come into the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus said to them, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” They told him, “Yes, Lord.” Then he touched their eyes, saying, “According to your faith be it done to you.” And their eyes were opened. And Jesus strictly commanded them, saying, “See that no one knows about this.” Matthew 9:27-30
Faith||Peter answered him and said, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the waters.” He said, “Come.” Peter stepped down from the boat, and walked on the water and went toward Jesus. But when he saw the strong wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he yelled, saying, “Lord, save me.” Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand, took hold of him, and said to him, “You of little faith, why did you doubt?” When they got up into the boat, the wind ceased. Matthew 14:28-32
Faith||And look, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders, and started shouting, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David. My daughter is severely demonized.” But he did not answer her a word. His disciples came and begged him, saying, “Send her away; for she cries after us.” But he answered, “I was not sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” But she came and worshiped him, saying, “Lord, help me.” But he answered, “It is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.” But she said, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.” Then Jesus answered her, “Woman, great is your faith. Be it done to you even as you desire.” And her daughter was healed from that hour. Matthew 15:22-28
Faith||The disciples came to the other side and had forgotten to take bread. Jesus said to them, “Watch out and guard yourselves against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” And they discussed it among themselves, saying, “Because we took no bread.” But Jesus, becoming aware of this, said, “You of little faith, why are you discussing among yourselves about having no bread? Do you still not understand, or remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up? Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up? Why is it that you do not understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” Matthew 16:5-11
Faith||Then the disciples came to Jesus privately, and said, “Why weren’t we able to cast it out?” So he said to them, “Because of your little faith. For truly I tell you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will tell this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.” Matthew 17:19-21
Faith||Jesus answered them, “Truly I tell you, if you have faith, and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you told this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ it would be done. All things, whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.”  Matthew 21:21-22
Faith||“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites. For you tithe mint, dill, and cumin, and have left undone the weightier matters of the Law: justice, mercy, and faith. But you ought to have done these, and not to have left the other undone.  Matthew 23:23
Faith||And on that day, when evening had come, he said to them, “Let us go over to the other side.” And leaving the crowd, they took him with them, even as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him. And a big wind storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was already filled. And he himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion, and they woke him up, and told him, “Teacher, do you not care that we are dying?” And he awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Peace. Be still.” And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. And he said to them, “Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?” Mark 4:35-40
Faith||And he said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be cured of your disease.” Mark 5:34
Faith||While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler’s house saying, “Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher any more?” But Jesus, overhearing the message spoken, said to the ruler of the synagogue, “Do not be afraid, only believe.” Mark 5:35-36
Faith||They brought him to him, and when he saw him, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and he fell on the ground, wallowing and foaming at the mouth. He asked his father, “How long has it been since this has come to him?” He said, “From childhood. And it has often cast him both into fire and into water, to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us, and help us.” Jesus said to him, “’If you can?’ All things are possible to him who believes.” Mark 9:20-23
Faith||They came to Jericho. As he went out from Jericho, with his disciples and a large crowd, Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the road. When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, and say, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.” Many rebuked him, that he should be quiet, but he shouted all the louder, “Son of David, have mercy on me.” Jesus stood still, and said, “Call him.” They called the blind man, saying to him, “Cheer up. Get up. He is calling you.” He, casting away his cloak, jumped up, and came to Jesus. Jesus asked him, “What do you want me to do for you?” The blind man said to him, “Rabboni, that I may see again.” Jesus said to him, “Go your way. Your faith has made you well.” And immediately he received his sight, and followed him on the road. Mark 10:46-52
Faith||Jesus answered them, “Have faith in God. Truly I tell you, whoever may tell this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him. Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours. Mark 11:22-24
Faith||He said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.” Luke 7:50
Faith||Now it happened on one of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples, and he said to them, “Let us go over to the other side of the lake.” So they launched out. But as they sailed, he fell asleep. A wind storm came down on the lake, and they were taking on dangerous amounts of water. So they came to him, and awoke him, saying, “Master, master, we are dying.” And he awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and it was calm. He said to them, “Where is your faith?” Being afraid they marveled, saying one to another, “Who is this, then, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?” Luke 8:22-25
Faith||He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace.” Luke 8:48
Faith||The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith.” The Lord said, “If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you would tell this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you.  Luke 17:5-6
Faith||As he entered into a certain village, ten men who were lepers met him, who stood at a distance. They lifted up their voices, saying, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.” When he saw them, he said to them, “Go and show yourselves to the priests.” It happened that as they went, they were cleansed. One of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice. He fell on his face at Jesus’ feet, giving him thanks; and he was a Samaritan. Jesus answered, “Weren’t the ten cleansed? But where are the nine? Were there none found who returned to give glory to God, except this stranger?” Then he said to him, “Get up, and go your way. Your faith has healed you.” Luke 17:12-19
Faith||Standing still, Jesus commanded him to be brought to him. When he had come near, he asked him, “What do you want me to do?” He said, “Lord, that I may see again.” Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight. Your faith has healed you.” And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God. All the people, when they saw it, praised God. Luke 18:40-43
Faith||“Simon, Simon, look, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat, but I prayed for you, that your faith would not fail. You, when once you have turned again, establish your brothers.” Luke 22:31-32
Faith||But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become God’s children, to those who believe in his name, who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. John 1:12-13
Faith||If I told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things? John 3:12
Faith||For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that whoever believes in him will not perish, but have everlasting life. For God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through him. He who believes in him is not judged. He who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.  John 3:16-18
Faith||From that city many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman, who testified, “He told me everything that I did.” So when the Samaritans came to him, they begged him to stay with them. He stayed there two days. Many more believed because of his word. They said to the woman, “Now we believe, not because of your speaking; for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Savior of the world.” John 4:39-42
Faith||The nobleman said to him, “Sir, come down before my child dies.” Jesus said to him, “Go your way. Your son lives.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way. As he was now going down, his servants met him, saying that his son was alive. So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. They said therefore to him, “Yesterday at one in the afternoon, the fever left him.” So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him, “Your son lives.” He believed, as did his whole house. John 4:49-53
Faith||“Truly, truly, I tell you, he who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has everlasting life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.  John 5:24
Faith||Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will not be hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty. John 6:35
Faith||This is the will of my Father, that everyone who sees the Son, and believes in him, should have everlasting life; and I will raise him up at the last day.” John 6:40
Faith||Now on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink. He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living water.” John 7:37-38
Faith||Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?” He answered, “Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?” Jesus said to him, “You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with you.” He said, “Lord, I believe.” and he worshiped him. John 9:35-38
Faith||Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will still live, even if he dies. And whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?” She said to him, “Yes, Lord. I have come to believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, he who comes into the world.” John 11:25-27
Faith||Jesus said to her, “Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see God’s glory?” John 11:40
Faith||Then Jesus shouted out and said, “Whoever believes in me, believes not in me, but in him who sent me. And he who sees me sees him who sent me. I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in me may not remain in the darkness.  John 12:44-46
Faith||“Do not let your heart be troubled. Believe in God. Believe also in me. John 14:1
Faith||Truly, truly, I tell you, he who believes in me, the works that I do, he will do also; and he will do greater works than these, because I am going to the Father. John 14:12
Faith||After eight days again his disciples were inside, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, the doors being locked, and stood in the midst, and said, “Peace be to you.” Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here, and observe my hands. Reach out your hand, and put it into my side; and do not be unbelieving, but believing.” Thomas answered and said to him, “My Lord and my God.” Jesus said to him, “Because you have seen me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen, and have believed.” John 20:26-29
Faith||By faith in his name, his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Yes, the faith which is through him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all. Acts 3:16
Faith||All the prophets testify about him, that through his name everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins.” Acts 10:43
Faith||They said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.” They spoke the word of the Lord to him, and to all who were in his house. Acts 16:31-32
Faith||For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you; that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith, both yours and mine. Romans 1:11-12
Faith||For I am not ashamed of the Good News, for it is the power of God for salvation for everyone who believes; for the Jew first, and also for the Greek. For in it is revealed God’s righteousness from faith to faith. As it is written, “But the righteous will live by faith.” Romans 1:16-17
Faith||But now apart from the law, a righteousness of God has been revealed, being testified by the Law and the Prophets; even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all and upon all who believe. For there is no distinction, for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God; being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus; whom God displayed publicly as a mercy seat, through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness, because in God’s forbearance he had passed over the sins previously committed; to demonstrate his righteousness at this present time, so that he would be just, and the justifier of him who has faith in Jesus. Romans 3:21-26
Faith||Where then is the boasting? It is excluded. By what manner of law? Of works? No, but by a law of faith. For we maintain that one is justified by faith apart from the works of the law. Romans 3:27-28
Faith||For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. For what does the Scripture say? “And Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.” Now to the one who works, the pay is not counted as a gift, but as an obligation. But to him who does not work, but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness. Even as David also pronounces blessing on the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works, “Happy are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Happy is the one whom the Lord will not charge with sin.” Romans 4:2-8
Faith||For this cause it is of faith, that it may be according to grace, to the end that the promise may be sure to all the descendants, not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all. Romans 4:16
Faith||As it is written, “I have made you a father of many nations.” This is in the presence of him whom he believed: God, who gives life to the dead, and calls the things that are not, as though they were. Romans 4:17
Faith||Who in hope believed against hope, to the end that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, “So will your descendants be.” Without being weakened in faith, he considered his own body, which was as good as dead (he being about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah’s womb. Yet, looking to the promise of God, he did not waver through unbelief, but grew strong through faith, giving glory to God, and being fully assured that what he had promised, he was able also to perform. And therefore “it was credited to him as righteousness.” Romans 4:18-22
Faith||Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ; through whom we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God. Romans 5:1-2
Faith||What should we say then? That the non-Jews, who did not follow after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith; but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, did not arrive at that law. Why? Because they did not seek it by faith, but as it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone; even as it is written, “Look, I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and a rock that will make them fall; and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.” Romans 9:30-33
Faith||For Moses writes about the righteousness of the law, “The one who does them will live by them.” But the righteousness which is of faith says this, “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’ (that is, to bring Christ down); or, ‘Who will descend into the abyss?’ (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)” But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth, and in your heart;” that is, the word of faith, which we proclaim: that if you will confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made, resulting in salvation. For the Scripture says, “Whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.” Romans 10:5-11
Faith||So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ. Romans 10:17
Faith||For I say, through the grace that was given me, to everyone among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think reasonably, as God has apportioned to each person a measure of faith. Romans 12:3
Faith||Do you have faith? Have it to yourself before God. Happy is he who does not judge himself in that which he approves. But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because it is not of faith; and whatever is not of faith is sin. Romans 14:22-23
Faith||My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, that your faith would not rest on human wisdom, but on the power of God. 1 Corinthians 2:4-5
Faith||If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. 1 Corinthians 13:2
Faith||But now faith, hope, and love remain—these three. The greatest of these is love. 1 Corinthians 13:13
Faith||If Christ has not been raised, your faith is vain; you are still in your sins. Then they also who are fallen asleep in Christ have perished. If we have only hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all people most to be pitied. 1 Corinthians 15:17-19
Faith||Watch. Stand firm in the faith. Be courageous. Be strong. Let all that you do be done in love. 1 Corinthians 16:13-14
Faith||But having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, “I believed, and therefore I spoke.” We also believe, and therefore also we speak; 2 Corinthians 4:13
Faith||for we walk by faith, not by sight. 2 Corinthians 5:7
Faith||I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I that live, but Christ living in me. That life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself up for me. Galatians 2:20
Faith||Foolish Galatians, who has cunningly deceived you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth as crucified? I just want to learn this from you. Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith? Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now completed in the flesh? Did you suffer so many things in vain, if it is indeed in vain? He therefore who supplies the Spirit to you, and works miracles among you, does he do it by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith? Even as Abraham “believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.” Galatians 3:1-6
Faith||Know therefore that those who are of faith, the same are children of Abraham. The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the non-Jews by faith, preached the Good News beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you all the nations will be blessed.” So then, those who are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham. Galatians 3:7-9
Faith||For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse. For it is written, “Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them.” Now it is evident that no one is justified by the law before God, for, “The righteous will live by faith.” The law is not of faith, but, “The one who does them will live by them.” Galatians 3:10-12
Faith||Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us. For it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,” that the blessing of Abraham might come on the non-Jews through Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. Galatians 3:13-14
Faith||But the Scriptures imprisoned all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, confined for the faith which should afterwards be revealed. So that the law has become our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor. For you are all children of God, through faith in Christ Jesus. Galatians 3:22-26
Faith||For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision amounts to anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love. Galatians 5:6
Faith||for by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, that no one would boast. Ephesians 2:8-9
Faith||that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that you may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner person; that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be strengthened to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know Christ’s love which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. Ephesians 3:16-19
Faith||above all, taking up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one. Ephesians 6:16
Faith||More than that, I count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord, for whom I suffered the loss of all things, and count them nothing but refuse, that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own, that which is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith; Philippians 3:8-9
Faith||As therefore you received Christ Jesus, the Lord, walk in him, rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, even as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving. Colossians 2:6-7
Faith||But let us, since we belong to the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and, for a helmet, the hope of salvation. 1 Thessalonians 5:8
Faith||We are bound to always give thanks to God for you, brothers, even as it is appropriate, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of each and every one of you towards one another abounds; 2 Thessalonians 1:3
Faith||To this end we also pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of your calling, and fulfill every desire of goodness and work of faith, with power; that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ. 2 Thessalonians 1:11-12
Faith||Fight the good fight of faith. Lay hold of the everlasting life to which you were called, and you confessed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses. 1 Timothy 6:12
Faith||From infancy, you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus. 2 Timothy 3:15
Faith||We desire that each one of you may show the same diligence to the fullness of hope even to the end, that you won’t be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherited the promises. Hebrews 6:11-12
Faith||and having a great priest over the house of God, let us draw near with a true heart in fullness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and having our body washed with pure water, let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering; for he who promised is faithful. Hebrews 10:21-23
Faith||For you need patient endurance so that, having done the will of God, you may receive the promise. “For in just a little while, he who is coming will come and will not delay. But the righteous will live by faith, and if he holds back, my soul has no pleasure in him.” But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to the saving of the soul. Hebrews 10:36-39
Faith||Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. Hebrews 11:1/KJV
Faith||Now faith is assurance of things hoped for, proof of things not seen. Hebrews 11:1/WEB
Faith||By faith, we understand that the universe has been framed by the word of God, so that what is seen has not been made out of things which are visible. Hebrews 11:3/WEB
Faith||By faith, Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, through which he was attested as righteous, God testifying with respect to his gifts; and though he died he still speaks through it. Hebrews 11:4
Faith||By faith, Enoch was taken away, so that he would not see death, “and he was not found, because God took him away.” For before he was taken he was attested as having pleased God. Hebrews 11:5
Faith||Without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him, for he who comes to God must believe that he exists, and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him. Hebrews 11:6
Faith||By faith, Noah, being warned about things not yet seen, moved with godly fear, prepared a ship for the saving of his house, through which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith. Hebrews 11:7/WEB
Faith||By faith, Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance. He went out, not knowing where he was going. By faith, he sojourned in a land of promise, as a foreigner, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise. For he looked for the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is God. Hebrews 11:8-10
Faith||By faith, even barren Sarah herself received power to conceive when she was past age, and gave birth, since she considered him faithful who had promised. Therefore as many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as innumerable as the sand which is by the sea shore, were fathered by one man, and him as good as dead. Hebrews 11:11-12
Faith||By faith, Abraham, being tested, offered up Isaac; and he who had gladly received the promises was offering up his one and only son; even he to whom it was said, “In Isaac will your descendants be called;” concluding that God is able to raise up even from the dead. Figuratively speaking, he also did receive him back from the dead. Hebrews 11:17-19
Faith||By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come. Hebrews 11:20
Faith||By faith, Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff. Hebrews 11:21
Faith||By faith, Joseph, when his end was near, made mention of the departure of the children of Israel; and gave instructions concerning his bones. Hebrews 11:22
Faith||By faith, Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that he was a beautiful child, and they were not afraid of the king’s commandment. Hebrews 11:23
Faith||By faith, Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, choosing rather to share ill treatment with God’s people, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a time; considering the reproach of the Messiah greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked to the reward. By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the anger of the king; for he endured as seeing him who is invisible. By faith, he kept the Passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them. By faith, they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land. When the Egyptians tried to do so, they were swallowed up. Hebrews 11:24-29
Faith||By faith, the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been encircled for seven days. By faith, Rahab the prostitute, did not perish with those who were disobedient, having received the spies in peace. Hebrews 11:30-31
Faith||And what more should I say? For the time would fail me if I told of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets; who, through faith subdued kingdoms, worked out righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, grew mighty in war, and caused foreign armies to flee. Women received their dead by resurrection. And others were tortured, not accepting the payment for release, that they might obtain a better resurrection. Hebrews 11:32-35
Faith||Therefore let us also, seeing we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews 12:1-2
Faith||Remember your leaders, who spoke to you the word of God, and considering the results of their conduct, imitate their faith. Hebrews 13:7
Faith||Count it all joy, my brothers, when you encounter various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. Let endurance have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. James 1:2-4
Faith||But let him ask in faith, without any doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind. James 1:6
Faith||What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith, but has no works? Can faith save him? And if a brother or sister is naked and in lack of daily food, and one of you tells them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled;” and yet you did not give them the things the body needs, what good is it? Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead in itself. But someone will say, “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me your faith without works, and I by my works will show you my faith. James 2:14-18
Faith||You believe that God is one. You do well. The demons also believe, and shudder. But do you want to know, foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless? Wasn’t Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar? You see that faith worked with his works, and by works faith was perfected; and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “And Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness;” and he was called the friend of God. You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. In like manner was not Rahab the prostitute also justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them out another way? For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead. James 2:19-26
Faith||Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord, and the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. If he has committed sins, he will be forgiven. James 5:14-15
Faith||Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials, that the genuineness of your faith, which is more precious than gold that perishes even though it is tested by fire, may be found to result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ— 1 Peter 1:6-7
Faith||Be sober and self-controlled. Be watchful. Your adversary the devil, walks around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. Withstand him steadfast in your faith, knowing that your brothers who are in the world are undergoing the same sufferings. And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen and establish you. 1 Peter 5:8-10
Faith||Yes, and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence, in your faith supply moral excellence; and in moral excellence, knowledge; and in knowledge, self-control; and in self-control patience; and in patience godliness; and in godliness brotherly affection; and in brotherly affection, love. For if these things are yours and abound, they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful to the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 2 Peter 1:5-8
Faith||For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world: our faith. 1 John 5:4

Peace||When a man’s ways please the LORD, he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him. Proverbs 16:7
Peace||Better is a dry morsel with quietness, than a house full of feasting with strife. Proverbs 17:1
Peace||The beginning of strife is like breaching a dam, therefore stop contention before quarreling breaks out. Proverbs 17:14
Peace||It is an honor for a person to keep away from strife, but every fool quarrels. Proverbs 20:3
Peace||If a wise man goes to court with a foolish man, the fool rages or scoffs, and there is no peace. Proverbs 29:9
Peace||Correct your son, and he will give you peace; yes, he will bring delight to your soul. Proverbs 29:17
Peace||Better is a handful, with quietness, than two handfuls with labor and chasing after wind. Ecclesiastes 4:6
Peace||For to us a child is born. To us a son is given; and the government will be on his shoulders. His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.

Understanding||Then was Daniel brought in before the king. The king spoke and said to Daniel, “Are you that Daniel, who are of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah? I have heard of you, that the spirit of the gods is in you, and that light and understanding and extraordinary wisdom are found in you. Daniel 5:13-14
Understanding||He instructed me, and talked with me, and said, “Daniel, I have now come forth to give you wisdom and understanding. At the beginning of your petitions the commandment went forth, and I have come to tell you, for you are greatly loved. Therefore consider the matter, and understand the vision. Daniel 9:22-23
Understanding||In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, even a great warfare. He understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision. Daniel 10:1/WEBME
Understanding||Prostitution, wine, and new wine take away understanding. Hosea 4:11
Understanding||I will not punish your daughters when they play the prostitute, nor your brides when they commit adultery; because the men consort with prostitutes, and they sacrifice with the shrine prostitutes; so the people without understanding will come to ruin. Hosea 4:14
Understanding||“Ephraim is like an easily deceived dove, without understanding. They call to Egypt. They go to Assyria. When they go, I will spread my net on them. I will bring them down like the birds of the sky. I will chastise them, as their congregation has heard. Hosea 7:11-12
Understanding||For whoever has, to him will be given, and he will have abundance, but whoever does not have, from him will be taken away even that which he has. Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing, they do not hear, neither do they understand. And in them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says, ‘In hearing you will hear, but will not understand, and seeing you will see, but not perceive. For the heart of this people has grown dull, and their ears are sluggish in hearing, and they have closed their eyes, otherwise they might see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn back, and I would heal them.’ Matthew 13:12-15
Understanding||When anyone hears the word of the kingdom, and does not understand it, the evil one comes, and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown by the roadside. Matthew 13:19
Understanding||And what was sown on the good ground, this is he who hears the word, and understands it, who truly bears fruit, and brings forth, some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty.” Matthew 13:23
Understanding||He summoned the crowd, and said to them, “Hear, and understand. That which enters into the mouth does not defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man.” Matthew 15:10-11
Understanding||And answering, Peter said to him, “Explain this parable to us.” So he said, “Do you also still not understand? Do you not understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly, and then out of the body? But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man. For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies. These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man.” Matthew 15:15-20
Understanding||But Jesus, becoming aware of this, said, “You of little faith, why are you discussing among yourselves about having no bread? Do you still not understand, or remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up? Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up? Why is it that you do not understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” Matthew 16:8-11
Understanding||And he called the crowd to himself again, and said to them, “Hear me, all of you, and understand. There is nothing from outside of the person, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the person are what defile the person.” Mark 7:14-16
Understanding||He said to them, “Are you thus without understanding also? Do you not perceive that whatever goes into the person from outside cannot defile him, because it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, cleansing all the foods?” He said, “That which proceeds out of the person, that defiles the person. For from within, out of a person’s heart, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts, covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness. All these evil things come from within, and defile the person.” Mark 7:18-23
Understanding||And they began discussing among themselves that they had no bread. He, perceiving it, said to them, “Why do you reason that it’s because you have no bread? Do you not perceive yet, neither understand? Are your hearts hardened? Having eyes, do you not see? Having ears, do you not hear? Do you not remember? When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?” They told him, “Twelve.” “When the seven loaves fed the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?” And they said, “Seven.” He asked them, “Do you not yet understand?” Mark 8:16-21
Understanding||They went out from there, and passed through Galilee. He did not want anyone to know it. For he was teaching his disciples, and said to them, “The Son of Man is being handed over to the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he is killed, after three days he will rise again.” But they did not understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him. Mark 9:30-32
Understanding||The scribe said to him, “Truly, Teacher, you have said well that he is one, and there is none other but he, and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.” When Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” No one dared ask him any question after that. Mark 12:32-34
Understanding||It happened after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them, and asking them questions. All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers. Luke 2:46-47
Understanding||Then his disciples asked him, “What does this parable mean?” He said, “To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest in parables; that ‘seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.’ Luke 8:9-10
Understanding||But they did not understand this saying. It was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying. Luke 9:45
Understanding||In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, “I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.” Luke 10:21
Understanding||They understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they did not understand the things that were said. Luke 18:34
Understanding||Then he opened their minds, that they might understand the Scriptures. Luke 24:45
Understanding||Nicodemus answered and said to him, “How can these things be?” Jesus answered him, “Are you the teacher of Israel, and do not understand these things? Truly, truly, I tell you, we speak that which we know, and testify of that which we have seen, and you do not receive our witness. If I told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?  John 3:9-12
Understanding||Why do you not understand my speech? Because you cannot hear my word. John 8:43
Understanding||“Truly, truly, I tell you, one who does not enter by the door into the sheep fold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. But one who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out. Whenever he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. They will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him; for they do not know the voice of strangers.” Jesus spoke this parable to them, but they did not understand what he was telling them. John 10:1-6
Understanding||If I do not do the works of my Father, do not believe me. But if I do them, though you do not believe me, believe the works; that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.” John 10:37-38
Understanding||And Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat on it. As it is written, ”Do not be afraid, daughter of Zion. Look, your King comes, sitting on a donkey’s colt.” His disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about him, and that they had done these things to him. John 12:14-16
Understanding||For this cause they could not believe, for Isaiah said again, He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, lest they should see with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and turn, and I would heal them. John 12:39-40
Understanding||Jesus answered him, “You do not know what I am doing now, but you will understand later.” John 13:7
Understanding||And running near, Philip heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, “Do you understand what you are reading?” He said, “How can I, unless someone explains it to me?” He begged Philip to come up and sit with him. Acts 8:30-31
Understanding||who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of understanding. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul, and sought to hear the word of God. Acts 13:7
Understanding||When they did not agree among themselves, they departed after Paul had spoken one word, “The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah, the prophet, to your fathers, saying, ‘Go to this people, and say, in hearing, you will hear, but will in no way understand. In seeing, you will see, but will in no way perceive. For this people’s heart has grown callous. Their ears are dull of hearing. Their eyes they have closed. Lest they should see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their heart, and would turn again, and I would heal them.’ Acts 28:25-27
Understanding||”There is no one who understands. There is no one who seeks after God. Romans 3:11
Understanding||But, as it is written, “Those who were not told about him, they will see, and those who have not heard, they will understand.” Romans 15:21
Understanding||Now the natural person does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned. 1 Corinthians 2:14
Understanding||For if I pray in another language, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful. What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also. I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also. 1 Corinthians 14:14-15
Understanding||I thank God I speak in tongues more than you all. However in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in another language. 1 Corinthians 14:18-19
Understanding||For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves. But they themselves, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding. 2 Corinthians 10:12
Understanding||By reading this, you will be able to grasp my understanding of the secret about the Messiah, which in previous generations was not made known to human beings as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God’s holy apostles and prophets. This is that secret: The gentiles are heirs-in-common, members-in-common of the body, and common participants in what was promised by the Messiah Jesus through the gospel. Ephesians 3:4-6/ISV
Understanding||This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the nations also walk, in the futility of their mind, being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardening of their hearts; who having become callous gave themselves up to lust, to work all uncleanness with greediness. Ephesians 4:17-19
Understanding||Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. Ephesians 5:17
Understanding||Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus. Philippians 4:6-7
Understanding||For this cause, we also, since the day we heard this, do not cease praying and making requests for you, that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, that you may walk worthily of the Lord, to please him in every way, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God; Colossians 1:9-10
Understanding||For I desire to have you know how greatly I struggle for you, and for those at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh; that their hearts may be comforted, they being knit together in love, and gaining all riches of the full assurance of understanding, that they may know the mystery of God, namely, Christ, in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden. Colossians 2:1-3
Understanding||but the goal of this command is love, out of a pure heart and a good conscience and unfeigned faith; from which things some, having missed the mark, have turned aside to vain talking; desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor about what they strongly affirm. 1 Timothy 1:5-7
Understanding||Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in all things. 2 Timothy 2:7
Understanding||By faith, we understand that the ages were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen has not been made out of things which are visible. Hebrews 11:3
Understanding||Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by his good conduct that his deeds are done in gentleness of wisdom. James 3:13
Understanding||Regard the patience of our Lord as salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote to you; as also in all of his letters, speaking in them of these things. In those, there are some things that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unsettled twist, as they also do to the other Scriptures, to their own destruction. 2 Peter 3:15-16
Understanding||We know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding, that we know him who is true, and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life. 1 John 5:20
Kindness||He said, “O LORD, the God of my master Abraham, please give me success this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham. Genesis 24:12
Kindness||He said, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his loving kindness and his truth toward my master. As for me, the LORD has led me in the way to the house of my master’s relatives.” Genesis 24:27
Kindness||Jacob said, “God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD, who said to me, ‘Return to your country, and to your relatives, and I will do you good,’ I am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses, and of all the truth, which you have shown to your servant; for with just my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I have become two companies. Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and strike me, and the mothers with the children. Genesis 32:9-11
Kindness||But the LORD was with Joseph, and showed kindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison. Genesis 39:21
Kindness||But remember me when it will be well with you, and show kindness, please, to me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house. Genesis 40:14
Kindness||“You, in your loving kindness, have led the people that you have redeemed. You have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation. Exodus 15:13
Kindness||“Do not make for yourselves an idol, nor any image of anything that is in the heavens above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: you must not bow yourself down to them, nor serve them, for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, upon the third and upon the fourth [generation] of those who hate me, and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments. Exodus 20:4-6
Kindness||The LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, “The LORD, the LORD, a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness and truth, keeping loving kindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin; and that will by no means clear [the guilty], visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children’s children, upon the third and on the fourth [generation].” Exodus 34:6-7
Kindness||‘The LORD is slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, forgiving iniquity and disobedience; and that will by no means clear [the guilty], visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth [generation].’ Numbers 14:18
Kindness||Please pardon the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your loving kindness, and according as you have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.” Numbers 14:19
Kindness||“Do not make an engraved image for yourself, or any likeness of what is in heaven above, or on the earth below, or that is in the waters below the earth. You must not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them; for I, the LORD, your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, upon the third and upon the fourth [generation] of those who hate me; and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments. Deuteronomy 5:8-10
Kindness||Know therefore that the LORD your God, he is God, the faithful God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness with them who love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations, and repays those who hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him who hates him, he will repay him to his face. Deuteronomy 7:9-10
Kindness||It shall happen, because you listen to these ordinances, and keep and do them, that the LORD your God will keep with you the covenant and the loving kindness which he swore to your fathers: and he will love you, and bless you, and multiply you; he will also bless the fruit of your body and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your new wine and your oil, the increase of your livestock and the young of your flock, in the land which he swore to your fathers to give you. Deuteronomy 7:12-13

Kindness||He said, “Blessed are you by the LORD, my daughter. You have shown more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as you didn’t follow young men, whether poor or rich. Ruth 3:10
Kindness||While I am still alive, show me the loving kindness of the LORD, that I not die. And also you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever. If not, when the LORD has cut off the enemies of David, each one from the surface of the earth, that the name of Jonathan is cut off from the house of David, then may the LORD require it at the hand of David’s enemies.” 1 Samuel 20:14-16
Kindness||David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead, and said to them, “Blessed are you by the LORD, that you have shown this kindness to your lord, even to Saul, and have buried him. Now may the LORD show loving kindness and truth to you. I also will reward you for this kindness, because you have done this thing. 2 Samuel 2:5-6
Kindness||but my loving kindness shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before you. 2 Samuel 7:15
Kindness||David said, “Is there yet any who is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?” 2 Samuel 9:1

Kindness||David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent by his servants to comfort him concerning his father. David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon. 2 Samuel 10:2
Kindness||He gives great deliverance to his king, and shows loving kindness to his anointed, to David and to his descendants, until forever.” 2 Samuel 22:51
Kindness||But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those who eat at your table; for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom your brother. 1 Kings 2:7
Kindness||Solomon said, “You have shown to your servant David my father great loving kindness, according as he walked before you in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with you.

Kindness||And he said, “LORD, the God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven above, or on earth beneath; keeping covenant and loving kindness with your servants, who walk before you with all their heart; who have kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him.

Kindness||it happened, when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised the LORD, saying, “For he is good; for his loving kindness endures forever,” then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the LORD, 2 Chronicles 5:13
Kindness||“LORD God, do not turn away the face of your anointed one. Remember your loving kindnesses to David your servant.” 2 Chronicles 6:42
Kindness||All the sons of Israel looked on, when the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD was on the house; and they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground on the pavement, and worshiped, and gave thanks to the LORD, saying, “For he is good; for his loving kindness endures for ever.” 2 Chronicles 7:3
Kindness||The priests stood, according to their positions; the Levites also with instruments of music of the LORD, which David the king had made to give thanks to the LORD, when David praised by their ministry, saying “For his loving kindness endures for ever.” The priests sounded trumpets before them; and all Israel stood. 2 Chronicles 7:6
Kindness||When he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed those who should sing to the LORD, and give praise in holy array, as they went out before the army, and say, Give thanks to the LORD; for his loving kindness endures forever.

Kindness||It happened, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven, and said, “I beg you, LORD, the God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments: Let your ear now be attentive, and your eyes open, that you may listen to the prayer of your servant, which I pray before you at this time, day and night, for the sons of Israel your servants while I confess the sins of the sons of Israel, which we have sinned against you. Yes, I and my father’s house have sinned. Nehemiah 1:4-6
Kindness||Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness, do not let all the travail seem little before you, that has come on us, on our kings, on our leaders, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day.

When he has leveled its surface, doesn’t he plant the dill, and scatter the cumin seed, and put in the wheat in rows, the barley in the appointed place, and emmer as its borders?

Instruction||If you are enduring discipline, God is dealing with you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline? But if you are without discipline, of which all have been made partakers, then you are illegitimate, and not sons. Hebrews 12:7-8
Instruction||Furthermore, we had earthly fathers who disciplined us, and we paid them respect. Should we not much rather be subject to the Father of spirits, and live? For they indeed, for a few days, disciplined us as seemed good to them; but he for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness. All discipline seems for the moment painful, not joyful; yet afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it. Hebrews 12:9-11
Instruction||Do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings, for it is good that the heart be established by grace, not by food, through which those who were so occupied were not benefited. Hebrews 13:9

Grace||Now for a little moment grace has been shown from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage. For we are bondservants; yet our God has not forsaken us in our bondage, but has extended loving kindness to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair its ruins, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.

Grace||Stephen, full of grace and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people. Acts 6:8
Grace||The report concerning them came to the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem. They sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch, who, when he had come, and had seen the grace of God, was glad. He exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they should remain true to the Lord. Acts 11:22-23
Grace||Now when the synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, urged them to continue in the grace of God. Acts 13:43
Grace||Therefore they stayed there a long time, speaking boldly in the Lord, who testified to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands. Acts 14:3
Grace||From there they sailed to Antioch, from where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled. Acts 14:26
Grace||God, who knows the heart, testified about them, giving them the Holy Spirit, just like he did to us. He made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith. Now therefore why do you tempt God, that you should put a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they are.” Acts 15:8-11
Grace||but Paul chose Silas, and went out, being commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord. Acts 15:40

Grace||to all who are in Rome, loved by God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Romans 1:7
Grace||for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God; being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus; Romans 3:23-24
Grace||For this cause it is of faith, that it may be according to grace, to the end that the promise may be sure to all the descendants, not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all. Romans 4:16
Grace||Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ; through whom we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God. Romans 5:1-2
Grace||But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if by the trespass of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God, and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many. Romans 5:15
Grace||For if by the trespass of the one, death reigned through the one; so much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, Jesus Christ. Romans 5:17
Grace||The law came in besides, that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace abounded more exceedingly; that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to everlasting life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 5:20-21
Grace||What should we say then? Should we continue in sin, that grace may abound? Absolutely not. We who died to sin, how could we live in it any longer? Romans 6:1-2
Grace||Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts. Neither present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God, as alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God. For sin will not have dominion over you. For you are not under law, but under grace. Romans 6:12-14
Grace||What then? Should we sin because we are not under law, but under grace? Absolutely not. Do you not know that when you present yourselves to someone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, whether of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness? But thanks be to God, that, whereas you were servants of sin, you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching to which you were entrusted. Being made free from sin, you became slaves of righteousness. Romans 6:15-18
Grace||I ask then, has God rejected his people? Absolutely not. For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. God did not reject his people, which he foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says about Elijah? How he pleads with God against Israel: “Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have broken down your altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.” But how does God answer him? “I have kept for myself seven thousand people, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.” Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace. Romans 11:1-5
Grace||And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. Romans 11:6
Grace||For I say, through the grace that was given me, to everyone among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think reasonably, as God has apportioned to each person a measure of faith. Romans 12:3
Grace||so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another. Having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us, if prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith; or service, let us give ourselves to service; or he who teaches, to his teaching; or he who exhorts, to his exhorting: he who gives, let him do it with liberality; he who rules, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness. Romans 12:5-8
Grace||But I write the more boldly to you in part, as reminding you, because of the grace that was given to me by God, that I should be a servant of Christ Jesus to the non-Jews, serving as a priest the Good News of God, that the offering up of the non-Jews might be made acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit. Romans 15:15-16
Grace||And the God of peace will quickly crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you. Romans 16:20
Grace||Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 1 Corinthians 1:3
Grace||I always thank my God concerning you, for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus; that in everything you were enriched in him, in all speech and all knowledge; even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you: so that you are not lacking in any gift, as you wait for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ; 1 Corinthians 1:4-7
Grace||According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another builds on it. But let each one be careful how he builds on it. 1 Corinthians 3:10
Grace||But by the grace of God I am what I am. His grace which was bestowed on me was not futile, but I worked more than all of them; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. 1 Corinthians 15:10
Grace||The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. 1 Corinthians 16:23
Grace||Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 2 Corinthians 1:2
Grace||For our boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience, that with pure motives and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God we conducted ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you. 2 Corinthians 1:12
Grace||For all things are for your sakes, that the grace, being multiplied through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God. 2 Corinthians 4:15
Grace||Working together, we entreat also that you not receive the grace of God in vain, for he says, “At an acceptable time I listened to you, and in a day of salvation I helped you.” Look, now is the “acceptable time.” Look, now is the “day of salvation.” 2 Corinthians 6:1-2
Grace||Moreover, brothers, we make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia; how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality. For according to their power, I testify, yes and beyond their power, they gave of their own accord, begging us with much entreaty to receive this grace and the fellowship in the service to the saints. This was not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God. 2 Corinthians 8:1-5
